# 🔨 SlideForge: The Intelligent PPTX Foundry

> **"Orchestrating Asset Intelligence through the Digital Blacksmith Engine."**

SlideForge is a metadata-driven AI orchestrator for PowerPoint (`.pptx`) assets. It transforms static presentations into a searchable, atomic repository of slides, allowing for high-speed remixing and generator workflows.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 The Digital Blacksmith (Gemini AI)
Leveraging **Google Gemini** in a multi-turn conversation architecture. SlideForge doesn't just "see" slides; it analyzes their semantic structure, visual hierarchy, and business context through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

### 🔍 Forensic Search
Find exactly what you need with multimodal search:
*   **Vector Similarity**: Find slides based on thematic meaning.
*   **Full Text Search (FTS)**: Precise keyword matching across thousands of decks.
*   **Word Similarity**: Heuristic matching for typos and variants.

### 🏗️ Atomic Slide Registry
Automatically breaks down PPTX files into individual "Asset Atoms":
*   **Visual Thumbnails**: Real-time high-fidelity PNG rendering.
*   **Metadata Extraction**: AI-generated summaries and keyword tagging.
*   **Logical Relationships**: Maintains provenance (which presentation, which slide number).

### 💰 Cloud Transparency
Real-time integration with **Google Cloud Billing**. monitor AI usage directly from the Forge header with glassmorphism-style health and balance indicators.
